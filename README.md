If you want to make a scratch project (https://scratch.mit.edu/) similar to this: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/837245959, you can git this whole repository and run the main.py file.

Steps:
- Git the repository, or download the repository as a zip and then extract all the files.
- Install all the dependencies (python3, libraries like: PILLOW, requests, math, urllib, json, shutil, os).
- Edit the "USERNAME" variable in main.py to be your scratch username.
- Run main.py and wait for the result! There should appear a new .sb3 file which can be loaded to scratch!
- If you decide to share your newly created scratch project, please credit codeGIO!
